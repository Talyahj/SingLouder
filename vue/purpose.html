            <p class="verses">[Verse 1]
                You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
                You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
                I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
                'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
                I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
                And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
                So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
                'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances</p>
            <p class="verses">[Chorus]
                Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
                'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
                Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
                Yeah, I know that I let you down
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>
            <p class="verses">[Drop]
                I'm sorry, yeah
                Sorry, yeah
                Sorry
                Yeah, I know that I let you down
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>
            <p class="verses">[Verse 2]
                I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
                But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
                I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
                Can we both say the words and forget this?</p>
            <p class="verses">[Chorus]
                Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

                Yeah, I know that I let you down
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
                I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
                'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
                Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
                Yeah, I know that I let you down
                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?</p>

                I'm sorry, yeah

                Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
                I'm sorry, yeah
                Sorry, oh
                Sorry

                For all the times that you rained on my parade
                And all the clubs you get in using my name
                You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
                You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't</p>
            <p class="verses">[Refrain]
                And I didn't wanna write a song
                'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
                I don't, but you still hit my phone up
                And baby, I'll be movin' on
                And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
                Maybe you should know that</p>
            <p class="verses">[Pre-Chorus]
                My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
                And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
                But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
            <p class="verses">[Chorus]
                'Cause if you like the way you look that much
                Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
                And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
                You should go and love yourself</p>
            <p class="verses">[Verse 2]
                But when you told me that you hated my friends
                The only problem was with you and not them
                And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
                And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>
            <p class="verses">[Refrain]
                And I didn't wanna write a song
                'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

            <p class="verses">[Bridge]
                For all the times that you made me feel small
                I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
                I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
                Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
